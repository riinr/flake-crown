  "description": "Executes a program as a user different from the user running `sue`. The target program is `exec`'ed which means, that it replaces the `sue` process you are using to run the target program. This simulates native tools like `su` and `sudo` and uses the same low-level POSIX tools to achieve that, but eliminates common issues that usually arise, when using those native tools.",
